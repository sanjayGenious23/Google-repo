In the political commentary, one of the most discussed views right now is that the AAP
 can emerge as the alternative to the Congress party. But the way AAP walked up in Punjab
 would be very different for the other states because the party has been fighting
 electoral politics in the state of Punjab for the past several years and was the 
main Opposition party. Similarly, in Punjab, the BJP was technically a non-existent
 political force. Venturing into other states will not be as easy because apart from
 Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the Congress is not in power in any other state.
